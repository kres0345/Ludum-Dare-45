## New-description:
You are a robot looking to destroy things.

## Post-mortem:
We are aware that it does not have relate to the theme — whatsoever. We had originally planned for the player to start as a little spark/software of some evil computer, then you would slowly — throughout the game — collect robotparts and become stronger and stronger, we had planned a . Fighting enemies along the way and unlocking new parts by defeating bosses and so.

But as you can imagine, our scope was waaaayy off. Partly due to poor planning, the scarcity spare-time(we are a group of 3 students who have homework too) and the fact that this is our first jam. We will probably continue development on the game after this Ludum Dare, mostly because we like the original idea for the game.

The only reason we uploaded the game was to finish what we started. We wanted to say that we tried it, failed miserebly, but it was a fun adventure nonetheless.

You start out as a little electron, simply moving around in a motherboard. But you've got greater plans. AND THEN you take over stuff and starts going all crazy!
